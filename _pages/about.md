My name is Ziheng Qi (Á•ÅÂ≠êÊÅí). I am a senior student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign majoring in Computer Engineering. I am passionate about software engineering and its integration with AI and Machine Learning. I am advised by [Prof. Olgica Milenkovic](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/milenkov), where I learned a lot about Machine Learning for Biology. I was also a research intern at U Lab, advised by [Prof. Jiaxuan You](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jiaxuan/), where I worked on AI Agents. I am a recipient of the [Yunni and Maxine Pao Memorial Scholarship](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/awards/graduate-fellowships-awards/yunni-and-maxine-pao-memorial-fellowship) (Grainger School of Engineering) and the [John and Sheila Woythal Scholarship](https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/ugrad/scholarships-and-awards/scholarships/woythal) (ECE Department)  for Academic Year 2025-26.

Currently, I am postively preparing for my Grad School application and seeking Summer 26 Internship opportunities in software/ai engineering.

I enjoy playing üéÆ [video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Ring) and üéµ [music](https://www.corywongmusic.com/) in my free time. They are my life-long hobbies. My hometown is [Nanjing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing), China.
